Abstract
Title. Music-assisted relaxation to improve sleep quality: meta-analysis.
Aim. This paper is a report of a meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the efficacy of
music-assisted relaxation for sleep quality in adults and elders with sleep complaints
with or without a co-morbid medical condition.
Background. Clinical studies have shown that music can influence treatment outcome in a positive and beneficial way. Music holds the promise of counteracting
psychological presleep arousal and thus improving the preconditions for sleep.
Data sources. We conducted a search in the Embase (1997 – July 2008), Medline
(1950 – July 2008), Cochrane (2000 – July 2008), Psychinfo (1987 – July 2008) and
Cinahl (1982 – July 2008) databases for randomized controlled trials reported in
English, German, French and Dutch. The outcome measure of interest was sleep
quality.
Methods. Data were extracted from the included studies using predefined data
fields. The researchers independently assessed the quality of the trials using the
Delphi list. Only studies with a score of 5 points or higher were included. A pooled
analysis was performed based on a fixed effect model.
Results. Five randomized controlled trials with six treatment conditions and a total
of 170 participants in intervention groups and 138 controls met our inclusion
criteria. Music-assisted relaxation had a moderate effect on the sleep quality of
patients with sleep complaints (standardized mean difference, À0Æ74; 95% CI:
À0Æ96, À0Æ46). Subgroup analysis revealed no statistically significant contribution of
accompanying measures.
Conclusion. Music-assisted relaxation can be used without intensive investment in
training and materials and is therefore cheap, easily available and can be used by
nurses to promote music-assisted relaxation to improve sleep quality.

JAN: REVIEW PAPER

Introduction
Music is one of the most-used self-help strategies to promote
sleep. Morin et al. (2006a) found that more then a quarter of
a randomly-selected sample of community-dwelling participants used music to promote their sleep. A survey among
urban people in Finland (Urponen et al. 1988) also showed
that music was the second most important factor in promoting sleep. The clinical and systematic use of music as a
(complementary) treatment in various medical conditions has
been a subject of study in recent decades.
Clinical studies show that music can influence human
emotions and treatment outcome in a positive way. A review
by Evans (2002) showed that music decreases the level of
anxiety during normal care delivery. Studies by Chan et al.
(2006) in patients undergoing a C-clamp procedure after
percutaneous coronary interventions and Almerud and
Peterson (2003) in mechanically-ventilated intensive care
patients showed positive and statistically significant changes
in physiological variables. Although some researchers report
statistically significant influences of sedative music on hormonal levels and the immune system, the precise mechanism
by which music may improve human well-being is still
unclear.
Because there is evidence that music has the potential to
reduce anxiety, it holds the promise for counteracting
psychological presleep arousal and thus improving the
preconditions for sleep. Moreover, Johnson (2003) has
suggested that music can decrease the frustration and dread
associated with sleep complaints. Therefore, the use of music
could be beneficial for people with sleep (onset) problems.
Even in patients with chronic sleep problems, whose frustration about not being able to fall asleep might be a perpetuating factor, music could potentially be beneficial.
Music might be a valuable contribution to the range of
non-pharmacological nursing interventions to promote sleep.
However, only one report about the actual use of music as a
sleep-promoting nursing intervention was found: GagnerTjellesen et al. (2001) found that nurses working in acute
inpatient settings reported music as the most often-used
independent therapeutic nursing intervention to enhance
sleep.
Non-pharmacological interventions, in particular cognitive
behavioural treatment, have been proven to be effective and
to have resulted in stable therapeutic changes over time
(Morin et al. 2006b). However, most non-pharmacological
interventions require a relatively large investment in training.
The systematic application of music interventions does not
involve large investments in training or tools. These interventions are ‘relatively inexpensive, readily available,

Music-assisted relaxation to improve sleep quality

portable, and completely subject controlled’ (Mornhinweg
& Voigner 1995, p 252).
The growing interest for non-pharmacological interventions has led to reviews evaluating the efficacy of such
strategies. Examples include reviews of psychological and
behavioural treatment (Morin et al. 2006b), bright light
therapy (Montgomery & Dennis 2002a) and physical exercise (Montgomery & Dennis 2002b). However, we could not
find a review about the efficacy of music as a sleep-promoting
intervention. A meta-analysis of data from previous research
findings might provide or enhance the evidence-base of such
an intervention.

The review
Aim
The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of
music-assisted relaxation (MAR) for sleep quality in adults
and elders with sleep complaints with or without a co-morbid
medical condition.

Design
A meta-analysis was conducted using data from five randomized controlled trials. We chose sleep quality as the
primary outcome measure for the intervention. The reason
for this choice was primarily practical: sleep quality can be
assessed without medical competences. This means that
professionals without medical training, such as nurses, are
able to assess it. Sleep quality refers to the multi-dimensionally assessed, subjective experience of sleep. It comprises
quantitative aspects of sleep, such as sleep duration, sleep
latency, and number of arousals, as well as more purely
subjective aspects, such as depth or restfulness of sleep
(Buijsse et al. 1989).
Subjective measures (assessed by standardized questionnaires) and objective measures (assessed via polysomnografic
recording or wrist actigraphy) are not necessarily concordant.
Lazic and Ogilvie (2006) argued that subjective self-report
measures could be subject to bias. However, self-reports
reflect the problem from a patient perspective and are
therefore highly valued.

Search methods
We conducted searches in Embase (1997 – July 2008),
Medline (1950 – July 2008), Cochrane (2000 – July 2008),
Psychinfo (1987 – July 2008) and Cinahl (1982 – July 2008)
for studies published in English, German, French or Dutch.

Keywords, titles and abstracts were searched. The search
terms ‘sleep’ or ‘insomnia’ in combination with ‘music’ or
‘music therapy’ were used. After the searches were completed, reference lists from identified studies were examined
to find additional studies.
Selection criteria were prespecified. We included published
randomized controlled trials performed in an adult (18–
60 years) or elderly (60 years or older) population with
primary sleep complaints or sleep complaints co-morbid with
a medical condition. Studies involving active use of music,
such as playing instruments, were excluded. Finally, studies
of people suffering neurological or severe cognitive disorders
(such as Parkinson or Alzheimer disease) were excluded.
Music-assisted relaxation comprises therapeutic relaxation
improving interventions in which music is the key ingredient.
We divided these interventions into two groups: (1) those
offered without additional measures and (2) those offered
with additional measures. Added measures are, for instance,
oral or written relaxation instructions. Use of this distinction
makes it possible to determine the contribution of these
additional relaxation-improving measures.
Music in the context of this meta-analysis was considered to
be recorded music, played by CD/DVD player, mp3 player,
tape-recorder or video recorder. The music must have been
intentionally applied for the promotion of sleep quality in a
passive way, that is, listening to music while resting or relaxing.
Music-assisted relaxation in the selected studies was
offered with patient preferred or selected music, or with
standardized music that had been intentionally composed to
relax or promote sleep. Many people experience slow rhythm
music, without a heavy beat, as relaxing. However, the effect
is strongly dependent on personal preferences.

(Verhagen et al. 1998). This is a 9-item list, assessing
randomization of allocation, blinding of allocation, group
comparison, inclusion criteria, blinding (assessor, therapist,
patient), presentation of estimates and intention-to-treat
analysis. Two reviewers (GN and BT) assessed the studies
independently. Only studies with a positive score on 5 or
more Delphi items (‡55% of the maximum attainable score)
were included. Consensus was achieved for all data.

Data abstraction
Search outcome
After removing duplicates, our initial broad search produced
a list of 236 references (see Figure 1). After carefully
reviewing the titles for relevance, this list was reduced to
27 potentially-relevant papers. Abstracts from all of these
were reviewed for usefulness. Seventeen were rejected as
obviously unsuitable (e.g. no trial). Ten remaining studies
were read in full. Of these ten, five did not meet the inclusion
criteria. The main reasons for rejection were non-comparability of data and low methodological quality (lack of
control).

Quality appraisal
The methodological quality of each selected study was
assessed using the Delphi list for quality assessment of RCTs
1358

Pre- and post-test means and standard deviations, demographic data and condition properties were extracted from
each included study. To evaluate two studies (Kullich et al.
2003, Harmat et al. 2008), the authors were contacted for
additional information.

Synthesis
Review Manager 5.0.12 (The Cochrane Collaboration 2008)
was used to calculate the effect sizes of the individual studies
and for calculation of the pooled mean difference. Since
continuous data from different scales were extracted, the
standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated for effect
size based on sample size (Cohen’s d with Hedges adjustment) and 95% confidence intervals for each study, and for
the pooled studies using variance analysis. Effect sizes of 0Æ2

are usually interpreted as small, those of 0Æ5 as moderate and
from 0Æ8 as large (Cohen 1988).
Potential statistical heterogeneity between the studies was
evaluated with a chi-square test. Statistically significant
heterogeneity was considered present when the P-value was
less than 5%. Publication bias was addressed by inspection of
the funnel plot (Begg 1994). A funnel plot is a scatter plot of
effect sizes against a measure of study size.

1989); the fifth study used the Richards-Campbell Sleep
Questionnaire (RCSQ) (Richards 1987). Five of the six
included conditions led to statistically significant improvement of the ‘total score’ for sleep quality. The music
condition in the study by Zimmerman et al. (1996)
approached statistical significance (P = 0Æ06). None of the
researchers reported adverse effects.

Quality of included studies

Results
Characteristics of included studies
The characteristics of the five studies that met the inclusion
criteria are presented in Table 1. The studies included a total
of 170 participants in intervention groups and 138 controls.
Mean participant age was 51 years and mean sample size was
69. Three studies involved patients in a hospital setting, one
was performed with community-dwelling elders and one was
performed with students. With exception of one study
(Hernandez-Ruiz 2005), all included studies had explicit
inclusion criteria and/or exclusion criteria (i.e. use of hypnotics, psychiatric condition, sleep apnoea).
The duration of the intervention varied between 20 and
45 minutes per session and the follow-up period varied
between two days to three weeks. With the exception of the
study by Harmat et al. (2008) and one condition in the study
by Zimmerman et al. (1996), the music in all included studies
was offered with an accompanying relaxation technique or
instruction. Kullich et al. (2003) used standardized music that
was intentionally composed for sleep promotion for every
participant. The other researchers used patient-preferred
music that could be selected from a list. Types of music used
in the four included studies were traditional folk-music
(Chinese orchestra), instrumental new age (synthesizer),
classical and modern instrumental soothing music (harp,
piano, and orchestra) and vocal soothing music.
The study by Harmat et al. (2008) comprised two
treatment conditions, music and an audio book, both
compared to the same control condition. The audio book
intervention comprised use of a CD containing 11 hours of
short stories. Since this condition did not involve music, it
was not included in the pooled analysis. The study by
Zimmerman et al. (1996) also had two treatment conditions,
music and music video, also both compared to the same
control condition. These two treatment conditions are
presented separately in Table 2.
In all included studies the efficacy of the intervention was
measured with a subjective, self-rating scale. Four studies
used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buijsse et al.

All included studies suffered from some methodological
flaws. The Delphi list score was mainly compromised by
the requirement for blinding. In high quality RCTs, a doubleblind process is used: neither participant nor administer
should be aware of whether the participant is in the
intervention or control group. However, the nature of the
intervention makes blinding of participants virtually impossible; when patients are informed about the goal and
procedure of the trial, as good ethical practice demands, it
is impossible to hide the condition to which they are
allocated. Randomization was blinded in all included studies.

Pooled analysis
The clinical diversity of the four studies seems rather large
(mixed age groups, various medical conditions). However,
there is no evidence or theory making a prominent difference in treatment effect between the various populations
plausible.
The outcomes of the two different used instruments, the
PSQI and the RCSQ, are not directly comparable; a high
PSQI value means a lower sleep quality, while a high RCSQ
value indicates the opposite. To allow calculation of the
effect size and standardized mean difference, RCSQ scores
were converted by subtracting the real score from the
maximum score.
Table 2 shows the means and calculated effect sizes of the
included studies. Since the studies did not show considerable
methodological diversity, a pooled analysis was conducted
(Figure 2). Because we assumed that the included studies
evaluated a common treatment effect, we chose the fixed
effect model.
An overall SMD of À0Æ74 (95% CI: À0Æ96 to À0Æ52) was
found. The Z test for overall effect was statistically significant
(Z = 6Æ59, P < 0Æ0001). The chi-square for statistical heterogeneity was not statistically significant (v2 = 7Æ84, d.f. = 5,
P = 0Æ17). The I-square test represents the between-trial
difference that cannot be attributed to chance. A value
greater than 50% may be considered substantial heterogeneity. In our case, the I-square was 36%. To detect publication

To determine the possible contribution of the accompanying relaxation measures, a subgroup analysis was performed.
The first group – MAR without added relaxation measures –
included two conditions in which music was the sole
component. The second group comprised four conditions in

which music was accompanied by an additional relaxation
measure. For the first group we found a SMD of À0Æ85 (95%
CI: À1Æ22 to À0Æ49), and for the second group a SMD of
À0Æ68 (95% CI: À0Æ95 to À0Æ40) was found. The test for

(v2 = 0Æ56, d.f. = 1, P = 0Æ45). However, this outcome must

What is already known about this topic
•
•

Music is one of the most-used self-help strategies to
promote sleep.
Clinical studies show that music can influence human
emotions and treatment outcomes in a positive way.

What this paper adds
•
•

Music-assisted relaxation has a moderate effect on the
sleep quality of patients with sleep complaints.
Music-assisted relaxation offers statistically significant
benefits for sleep quality without side effects in patients
with various conditions.

Implications for practice and/or policy

•

Music-assisted relaxation can be used without intensive investment in training and materials and is therefore cheap and easily available.

improve sleep quality.

heterogeneity for the first group was statistically significant
(v2 = 4Æ91, d.f. = 1, P = 0Æ03).
We explored the influence of follow-up length on the effect
size by performing a regression analysis with effect size as the
dependent variable and follow-up length as the independent
variable. The result was not statistically significant (F = 3Æ13,
d.f. = 1, P = 0Æ15).

Discussion

small. Inspection of the funnel plot showed rough symmetry.
However, this is only a rough indication of the absence of
publication bias, and as only six conditions were included,
this is not a very reliable test.
The clinical diversity of the included studies was large. The
question might arise whether pooling the data was appropriate. However, the findings are very consistent. This could
mean that the effect of the intervention is independent of the
patient’s condition and thus that the generalizability of the
findings is potentially large.
Regrettably, none of the studies we included gave followup data to evaluate long-term effectiveness. However, followup length might be an important factor. At first glance our
data suggest that studies with a short implementation resulted
in lower effect sizes than those with longer implementation
periods. The studies by Kullich et al. (2003), Lai and Good
(2003) and Harmat et al. (2008) showed a cumulative dose
effect and reached no ‘plateau’ after three weeks. However, a
regression analysis revealed that follow-up length was not a
statistically significant predictor of effect size.
To evaluate the clinical relevance, we compared this result
with the results of two other meta-analyses. Like our metaanalysis, they both used randomized controlled trials and
sleep quality as outcome measures. However, both included
studies that enrolled participants with a diagnosis of primary
insomnia. The first, by Nowell et al. (1997), evaluated the
efficacy of benzodiazepines and zolpidem in adult patients
(18–65 years). Based on five studies, they found a standardized mean difference of 0Æ62 (95% CI: 0Æ45–0Æ79) for sleep
quality. The second, by Irwin et al. (2006), included a metaanalysis to evaluate the efficacy of behavioural interventions
for insomnia among middle aged and older adults. For the
outcome sleep quality, seven studies were included. A
standardized mean difference of 0Æ79 (95% CI: 0Æ46–1Æ1)
was found.

Weaknesses and strengths
The included studies all suffered from some methodological
weaknesses. The most important was the lack of doubleblinding. However, as stated previously, the nature of this
intervention makes blinding virtually impossible. Another
limitation of the included studies was the lack of a good
definition of the sleep problem. As poor perceived sleep
quality can have different causes (for instance physical,
neurological, psychological or hormonal) and some sleep
problems are unlikely to be influenced by music-assisted
relaxation (i.e. restless legs of sleep apnoea).
The main limitation of this review was a general limitation
of all reviews: it is liable to publication bias. The number of
included studies and the sample sizes in these studies were
1362

Conclusion
The results of this review, based on five relatively small
studies, show that music-assisted relaxation is an effective aid
for improving sleep quality in patients with various conditions. It also gave an indication that the contribution of
added relaxation-improving measures such as oral or written
instructions to the improvement of sleep quality is limited.
Since the amount of included studies was small, this is not a
conclusive statement.
Music is already one of the most commonly-used self-help
strategies to promote sleep. We found scientific support for
the effectiveness of the systematic use of music-assisted
relaxation to promote sleep quality. Since no adverse effects

are reported, nurses can use these findings in their practice to
promote music-assisted relaxation. It is a safe and cheap
intervention which may be used to treat sleep problems in
various populations. The use of MAR is quick and easy to
learn, and it might also be an effective element in a multifaceted intervention combining cognitive-behavioural and/or
educational elements. However, this requires further exploration.
Determining the most effective form (duration of exposure,
timing of exposure) of music intervention and type for
different populations (e.g. adolescents, elders) are interesting
topics for future study. Since objective and subjective
outcome measures reflect different dimensions of sleep,
researchers should preferably assess both. Strict inclusion
criteria based on a good definition of the sleep problem is
highly recommended for future research.
